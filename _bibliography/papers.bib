  abstract      = {We propose WSAUC, a unified and robust AUC optimization framework for weakly supervised AUC optimization. The framework covers multiple scenarios including noisy labeled AUC optimization, positive-unlabeled AUC optimization, multi-instance AUC optimization, and semi-supervised AUC optimization with or without noise. The framework achieves robust AUC optimization through a novel variety of AUC, i.e., rpAUC. Theorical and empirical results validate the effectiveness of the framework.},

  abstract    = {We propose the CALE framework to unify and enhance the two main objectives of domain adaptation: discriminability and transferability. To achieve this, CALE swaps the cooperative examples of the two objectives, enabling the learning of discriminability and transferability to mutually benefit each other. Additionally, adversarial examples are utilized to enhance the robustness of the two objectives themselves. The framework can be applied to improve current domain adaptation approaches and has been shown to outperform existing state-of-the-art methods.},

  pdf         = {aaai23-xiez.pdf},
  abstract    = {In this paper, we address a special scenario of semi-supervised learning, where the label missing is caused by a preceding ﬁltering mechanism, i.e., an instance can enter a subsequent process in which its label is revealed if and only if it passes the ﬁltering mechanism. The rejected instances are prohibited to enter the subsequent labeling process due to economical or ethical reasons, making the support of the labeled and unlabeled distributions isolated from each other. In this case, classical semi-supervised learning approaches are prone to fail. We propose a SmallPaced Self-Training framework, which iteratively discovers labeled and unlabeled instance subspaces with bounded Wasserstein distance. We theoretically prove that such a framework may achieve provably low error on the pseudo labels during learning, and validate the approach through experiments.},
