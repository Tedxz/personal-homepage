bio: |
  I am a Ph.D. candidate of [Department of Computer Science and Technology](http://cs.nju.edu.cn/) in [Nanjing University](http://www.nju.edu.cn/), and a member of [LAMDA Group](http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/), led by [Prof. Zhi-Hua Zhou](http://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/). Before that, I received my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Technology in June 2016 from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/).

  <!-- ## research interests -->
  I am interested in topics of machine learning, especially learning from imbalanced and incomplete supervision. Related topics include AUC optimization, learn to rank, positive-unlabeled learning, self-training, and semi-supervised learning on graphs.
